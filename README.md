# Startup Name Generator

My first application coded in Dart using the flutter framework. 

## Inner Working 

The application uses an English dictationary package to import many english words. It then takes these words and generates pairs in pascal case, with each pair meant to represent a potential starst up name. Finally, for all purposes, an infinite list of these names are generated and the user can pick and choose which ones they like. They can also then view their choices in a special folder.
